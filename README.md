GcmHello
=================================

Modified from google GCM quickstart example. See:
git clone https://github.com/googlesamples/google-services.git

Intention of this app is to create a reflector message passing
service using GCM such that all devices belonging to a single
user (per google account id) can broadcast messages to all devices
in the group through GCM. 

Please refer to google documentation for the basics of GCM and for
operation of the sources this project builds upon.
